  - C++ (C++17, C++20 Concepts)  
  - Python (Flask, scripting, automation)  
  - C# (.NET Core)  
  - Java  

- **Technologies & Tools**:  
  - Linux (Daily-Driver, DevOps, Shell Scripting)  
  - LLVM (Clang, clang-format)  
  - CMake, Git, ANTLR4  
  - AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)  
  - Docker & Containerization  

- **Domains**:  
  - Systems Programming & Architecture  
  - Secure Software Development & Cybersecurity Principles  
  - Cross-Platform Software Engineering  
  - Agile Methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)  

## My Current Aspirations

1. **Secure Software Architecture**: I aim to integrate security best practices seamlessly into the development process‚Äîfrom early design phases to deployment.  
2. **Contributing to Compiler and Build-System Technologies**: With a passion for performance and code quality, I‚Äôm keen on improving modern compiler toolchains and build systems.  
3. **Mastering Cloud & Container Security**: As hybrid and cloud-first approaches become more prevalent, I‚Äôm enhancing my knowledge of container orchestration and cloud-centric security models.
